// Blocking queue used for passing inbound RPC calls to the service handler pool.
// Calls are dequeued in 'earliest-deadline first' order. The queue also maintains a
// bounded number of calls. If the queue overflows, then calls with deadlines farthest
// in the future are evicted.
//
// When calls do not provide deadlines, the RPC layer considers their deadline to
// be infinitely in the future. This means that any call that does have a deadline
// can evict any call that does not have a deadline. This incentivizes clients to
// provide accurate deadlines for their calls.
//
// In order to improve concurrent throughput, this class uses a LIFO design:
// Each consumer thread has its own lock and condition variable. If a
// consumer arrives and there is no work available in the queue, it will not
// wait on the queue lock, but rather push its own 'ConsumerState' object
// to the 'waiting_consumers_' stack. When work arrives, if there are waiting
// consumers, the top consumer is popped from the stack and woken up.
//
// This design has a few advantages over the basic BlockingQueue:
// - the worker who was most recently busy is the one which will be selected for
//   new work. This gives an opportunity for the worker to be scheduled again
//   without going to sleep, and also keeps CPU cache and allocator caches hot.
// - in the common case that there are enough workers to fully service the incoming
//   work rate, the queue implementation itself is never used. Thus, we can
//   have a priority queue without paying extra for it in the common case.
//
// NOTE: because of the use of thread-local consumer records, once a consumer
// thread accesses one LifoServiceQueue, it becomes "bound" to that queue and
// must never access any other instance.
