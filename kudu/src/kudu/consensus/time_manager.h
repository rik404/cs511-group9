// Manages timestamp assignment to consensus rounds and safe time advancement.
//
// The TimeManager is used in conjunction with the MvccManager to define and
// uphold the safe time, i.e. a timestamp before which all ops have been
// applied to the tablet or are in-flight, which is useful for enabling
// repeatable reads.
//
// Example of a leader TimeManager updating the safe time:
// - TimeManager::AssignTimestamp() returns a timestamp T that is higher than
//   any other replicated by a leader.
// - An op is registered with the MvccManager with the timestamp T.
//   Conceptually, T is thusly considered safe. Since all future ops will be
//   assigned higher timestamps, all ops that would have assigned a lower
//   timestamps are already complete or in-flight.
// - The op is written to the WAL via the ConsensusQueue, and then replicated;
//   TimeManger::AdvanceSafeTimeWithMessage() is called with the replicate
//   message of the op with timestamp T, signifying the new safe time.
//   - Until this step completes, snapshot scans, which call WaitUntilSafe(t)
//     where t >= T, will block.
//
// On followers, safe time is advanced via the following methods, called from
// the Raft threads:
// - MessageReceivedFromLeader() is used by followers on replicate messages
//   received by the leader to ensure that, if the follower were to become
//   leader, any timestamps assigned would be higher than any previously
//   replicated timestamps. This does not bump safe time, but it does ensure
//   that, were this node to become leader, any later assigned timestamp will
//   be higher than T.
// - AdvanceSafeTime() is used by followers using the safe timestamps that are
//   heartbeated from leader, used for the sake of snapshot scans.
//
// The leader's safe time moves with its clock unless there has been a op that
// was assigned a timestamp that is not yet known by the queue (i.e.
// AdvanceSafeTimeWithMessage() hasn't been called on the corresponding
// message). In this case the TimeManager returns the last known safe time.
//
// This class's leadership status is meant to be in tune with the queue's as
// the queue is responsible for broadcasting safe time from a leader (and will
// eventually be responsible for calculating that leader's lease).
//
// NOTE: Until leader leases are implemented the cluster's safe time can
// occasionally move back.  This does not mean, however, that the timestamp
// returned by GetSafeTime() can move back.  GetSafeTime will still return
// monotonically increasing timestamps, it's just that, in certain corner
// cases, the timestamp returned by GetSafeTime() can't be trusted to mean that
// all future messages will be assigned future timestamps.  This anomaly can
// cause non-repeatable reads in certain conditions.
//
// Multi-op transactions
// ---------------------
// Transaction participant leaders also help orchestrate the assignment of its
// commit timestamp. Below is an example of how the TimeManager and MvccManager
// can be used to handle assignment of a commit timestamp:
// - The BEGIN_COMMIT op is assigned a timestamp T_bc by the participant
//   leader via the above steps, denoting T_bc as safe.
// - Unlike a regular (e.g. write) op, the MVCC op registered for BEGIN_COMMIT
//   is not finished when the op is applied -- instead, the MVCC op is
//   maintained in memory for the time being.
//   - Until the MVCC op is completed below, further snapshot scans at t where
//     t > T_bc will block.
// - T_bc is sent to the transaction coordinator, and a commit timestamp
//   T_commit is determined that is higher than all timestamps that were
//   returned by the participants.
// - The coordinator effects a FINALIZE_COMMIT op on participants; the request
//   contains T_commit.
// - Before starting the FINALIZE_COMMIT op, the leader updates its clock using
//   TimeManager::UpdateClockAndLastAssignedTimestamp(), guaranteeing the next
//   timestamp assigned will be higher than T_commit.
// - The FINALIZE_COMMIT op is assigned a timestamp T_fc > T_commit by the
//   participant leader via the above steps, denoting T_fc as safe.
// - The MVCC op from earlier is used in lieu of a new MVCC op; since this op
//   has been in-flight for the duration of the commit process, any scans at
//   time t >= T_commit must have called WaitUntilSafe(t), followed by
//   MvccManager::WaitForSnapshotWithAllCommitted(t), thereby waiting for all
//   ops below t to complete.
//
// This class is thread safe.
