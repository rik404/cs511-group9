= Building Kubernetes StatefulSet Kudu Cluster

NOTE: All of this work is experimental and subject to change or removal.

== Getting Started

Kubernetes â€” container-orchestration system for automating application deployment, scaling, and management.

NOTE: Read more about Kubernetes here https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/

==== System Requirements

- `minikube` or `kubeadm` to deploy your Kubernetes cluster. Start a Kubernetes
  cluster before running through the next steps
- `kubectl` to run commands against the Kubernetes cluster
- `docker` to serve containers

==== Build Kudu Docker Image

    ../../docker/docker-build.py

==== Creating Namespace

    kubectl create -f ../namespace.yaml

=== Create Services for Kudu Masters and Kudu TServers

    kubectl create -f kudu-services.yaml

Check status of kudu services:

    kubectl get services -n apache-kudu

You should see below output on stdout

```
NAME             TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)             AGE
kudu-master-ui   NodePort    10.108.52.243   <none>        8051:30239/TCP      87m
kudu-masters     ClusterIP   None            <none>        8051/TCP,7051/TCP   87m
kudu-tservers    ClusterIP   None            <none>        8050/TCP,7050/TCP   87m
```

=== Create StatefulSet for Kudu Masters and Kudu TServers

    kubectl create -f kudu-statefulset.yaml

Check status of kudu statefulset:

    kubectl get statefulset -n apache-kudu

    kubectl get pods -n apache-kudu

You should see below output on stdout

```
NAME           READY   AGE
kudu-master    3/3     89m
kudu-tserver   4/4     89m


NAME             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
kudu-master-0    1/1     Running   1          90m
kudu-master-1    1/1     Running   1          90m
kudu-master-2    1/1     Running   0          89m
kudu-tserver-0   1/1     Running   1          90m
kudu-tserver-1   1/1     Running   1          90m
kudu-tserver-2   1/1     Running   1          90m
kudu-tserver-3   1/1     Running   1          90m
```

==== Port Forward The Kudu Master UI

    kubectl port-forward kudu-master-0 8051 -n apache-kudu
    OR
    minikube service kudu-master-ui --url -n apache-kudu

==== Destroy The Kudu Cluster

Destroy Services:

    kubectl delete -f kudu-services.yaml

Destroy StatefulSets:

    kubectl delete -f kudu-statefulset.yaml

==== Display Kudu Master Logs:

    kubectl logs kudu-master-0 --namespace apache-kudu
