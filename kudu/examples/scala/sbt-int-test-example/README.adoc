= SBT Integration Test example README

This is an example program that uses the Kudu test utilities to demonstrate integration testing
in a Scala/SBT application:

- Create a table

To run the example integration tests, ensure SBT is installed and execute
the following from the 'sbt-int-test-example' directory. This will execute all Scalatest test classes
in the 'src/it/scala' directory:

[source,bash]
----
$ sbt it:test
----


== Configuration
To configure SBT for retrieving the correct kudu testing binary jar, there is a required SBT plugin:

[source,sbt]
.project/plugins.sbt
----
resolvers += "phData Releases" at "https://repository.phdata.io/artifactory/libs-release" //<1>
classpathTypes += "maven-plugin"                                                          //<2>
addSbtPlugin("io.phdata" % "sbt-os-detector" % "0.2.0")                                   //<3>
----
<1> Include an additional repository for plugin resolution
<2> Include dependencies that are of type 'maven-plugin' which is required to resolve https://github.com/trustin/os-maven-plugin[OS Maven Plugin]
<3> The https://github.com/phdata/sbt-os-detector[SBT OS Detector] plugin

In the `build.sbt`, include the dependencies for kudu-test-utils and kudu-binary:
[source,sbt]
----

lazy val root = (project in file("."))
  .configs(IntegrationTest)
  .enablePlugins(OsDetectorPlugin) //<1>
  .settings(
    Defaults.itSettings,
    name := "sbt-int-test-example",
    libraryDependencies += "org.scalatest" %% "scalatest" % "3.0.8" % "it,test",
    libraryDependencies += "org.apache.kudu" % "kudu-client" % "1.17.0",
    libraryDependencies += "org.apache.kudu" % "kudu-test-utils" % "1.17.0" % "it", //<2>
    libraryDependencies += "org.apache.kudu" % "kudu-binary" % "1.17.0" % "it" classifier osDetectorClassifier.value, //<3>
    libraryDependencies += "ch.qos.logback" % "logback-classic" % "1.2.3",
  )
----
<1> Enable the SBT OS Detector plugin
<2> Provides utilities for working with the Kudu test cluster
<3> `kudu-binary` dependency that matches the current operating system.  Note: Linux and MacOS are
the only compile targets for Kudu.

Once dependencies are resolved, creating integration tests are straightforward:
[source,scala]
----
class KuduExampleITest extends FunSuite with BeforeAndAfter {

  private val harness = new KuduTestHarness() //<1>

  before {
    harness.before() //<3>
  }

  after {
    harness.after() //<3>
  }

  test("create table example") {
    val kuduExample = new KuduExample(harness.getClient) //<2>
    val tableName = "testMovies"
    val testMovieTable = kuduExample.createMovieTable(tableName)
    testMovieTable match {
      case Failure(exception) => fail(exception)
      case Success(table) => assertResult(tableName)(table.getName)
    }
  }
}
----
<1> Create a new instance of the `KuduTestHarness` to use the default settings of the `MiniKuduCluster`
<2> Kudu clients (both sync and async) are provided automatically by the test harness
<3> Ensure your `MiniKuduCluster` is properly started and terminated after testing.
