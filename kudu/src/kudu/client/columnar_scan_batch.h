/// This type of batch is used if the KuduScanner::COLUMNAR_LAYOUT row format flag
/// is enabled.
///
/// Retrieving rows in columnar layout can be significantly more efficient. It saves
/// some CPU cycles on the Kudu cluster and can also enable faster processing of the
/// returned data in certain client applications.
///
/// The columnar data retrieved by this class matches the columnar encoding described by
/// Apache Arrow[1], but without the alignment and padding guarantees that are made by
/// the Arrow IPC serialization.
