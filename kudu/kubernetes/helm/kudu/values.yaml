# NOTE: WALs and data directories will be placed in separate volumes if more
# than one is available. If only one is available, they will be placed in the
# same volume. Thus, users should avoid switching between a single-volume
# deployment and multi-volume deployments, as that would move the data
# directory location from /mnt/disk0 to /mnt/disk1,/mnt/disk2,..., and servers
# would be unable to find their existing data directory in /mnt/disk0!
